    <abstract>
      <t>An Entity Attestation Token (EAT) provides an attested claims set
that describes state and characteristics of an entity,
a device like a phone, IoT device, network equipment or such.  This claims set is used by a
relying party, server or service to determine how much it wishes to trust the entity.</t>
      <t>An EAT is either a CBOR Web Token (CWT) or JSON Web Token (JWT) with attestation-oriented 
claims. To a large degree, all this document does is extend
CWT and JWT.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="introduction" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>EAT provides the definition of a base set of claims that can be made about an entity, a device, some software and/or some hardware.
This claims set is received by a relying party who uses it to decide if and how it will interact with the remote entity.
It may choose to not trust the entity and not interact with it.
It may choose to trust it.
It may partially trust it, for example allowing monetary transactions only up to a limit.</t>
      <t>EAT defines the encoding of the claims set in CBOR <xref target="RFC8949" format="default"/> and JSON <xref target="RFC7159" format="default"/>.
EAT is an extension to CBOR Web Token (CWT) <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/> and JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The claims set is secured in transit with the same mechanisms used by CWT and JWT, in particular CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) <xref target="RFC8152" format="default"/> and JSON Object Signing
   and Encryption (JOSE) <xref target="RFC7515" format="default"/> <xref target="RFC7516" format="default"/>.
Authenticity and integrity protection must always be provided.
Privacy (encryption) may additionally be provided.
The key material used to sign and encrypt is specifically created and provisioned for the purpose of attestation.
It is the use of this key material that make the claims set "attested" rather than just some parameters sent to the relying party by the device.</t>
      <t>EAT is focused on authenticating, identifying and characterizing implementations where implementations are devices, chips, hardware, software and such.
This is distinct from protocols like TLS <xref target="RFC8446" format="default"/> that authenticate and identify servers and services.
It is equally distinct from protocols like SASL <xref target="RFC4422" format="default"/> that authenticate and identify persons.</t>
      <t>The notion of attestation is large, ranging over a broad variety of use cases and security levels.
Here are a few examples of claims:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Make and model of manufactured consumer device</li>
        <li>Make and model of a chip or processor, particularly for a security-oriented chip</li>
        <li>Identification and measurement of the software running on a device</li>
        <li>Configuration and state of a device</li>
        <li>Environmental characteristics of a device like its GPS location</li>
        <li>Formal certifications received</li>
      </ul>
      <t>EAT also supports nesting of sets of claims and EAT tokens for use with complex composite devices.</t>
      <t>This document uses the terminology and main operational model defined in <xref target="RATS.Architecture" format="default"/>.
In particular, it can be used for RATS Attestation Evidence and Attestation Results.</t>
      <section anchor="entity-overview" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Entity Overview</name>
        <t>The document uses the term "entity" to refer to the target of the attestation token.
The claims defined in this document are claims about an entity.</t>
        <t>An entity is an implementation in hardware, software or both.</t>
        <t>An entity is the same as the Attester Target Environment defined in RATS Architecture.</t>
        <t>An entity also corresponds to a "system component" as defined in the Internet Security Glossary <xref target="RFC4949" format="default"/>.
That glossary also defines "entity" and "system entity" as something that may be a person or organization as well as a system component.
Here "entity" never refers to a person or organization.</t>
        <t>An entity is never a server or a service.</t>
        <t>An entity may be the whole device or it may be a subsystem, a subsystem of a subsystem and so on.
EAT allows claims to be organized into submodules, nested EATs and so on. See <xref target="submods" format="default"/>.
The entity to which a claim applies is the submodule in which it appears, or to the top-level entity if it doesn't appear in a submodule.</t>
        <t>Some examples of entities:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>A Secure Element</li>
          <li>A TEE</li>
          <li>A card in a network router</li>
          <li>A network router, perhaps with each card in the router a submodule</li>
          <li>An IoT device</li>
          <li>An individual process</li>
          <li>An app on a smartphone</li>
          <li>A smartphone with many submodules for its many subsystems</li>
          <li>A subsystem in a smartphone like the modem or the camera</li>
        </ul>
        <t>An entity may have strong security like defenses against hardware invasive attacks.
It may also have low security, having no special security defenses.
There is no minimum security requirement to be an entity.</t>

      <section anchor="cwt-jwt-uccs-ujcs-and-deb" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>CWT, JWT, UCCS, UJCS and DEB</name>
        <t>An EAT is a claims set about an entity based on one of the following:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>CBOR Web Token (CWT) <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/></li>
          <li>Unprotected CWT Claims Sets (UCCS) <xref target="UCCS.Draft" format="default"/></li>
          <li>JSON Web Token (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/></li>
        </ul>
        <t>All definitions, requirements, creation and validation procedures, security considerations, IANA registrations and so on from these carry over to EAT.</t>
        <t>This specification extends those specifications by defining additional claims for attestation.
This specification also describes the notion of a "profile" that can narrow the definition of an EAT, ensure interoperability and fill in details for specific usage scenarios.
This specification also adds some considerations for registration of future EAT-related claims.</t>
        <t>The identification of a protocol element as an EAT, whether CBOR or JSON encoded, follows the general conventions used by CWT, JWT and UCCS.
Largely this depends on the protocol carrying the EAT.
In some cases it may be by content type (e.g., MIME type).
In other cases it may be through use of CBOR tags.
There is no fixed mechanism across all use cases.</t>
        <t>This specification adds two more top-level messages:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Unprotected JWT Claims Set (UJCS) <xref target="UJCS" format="default"/></li>
          <li>Detached EAT Bundle (DEB), <xref target="DEB" format="default"/></li>
        </ul>
        <t>A DEB is structure to hold a collection of detached claims sets and the EAT that separately provides integrity and authenticity protection for them.
It can be either CBOR or JSON encoded.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="cddl-cbor-and-json" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>CDDL, CBOR and JSON</name>
        <t>This document defines Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC8949" format="default"/> and Javascript Object Notation (JSON) <xref target="RFC7159" format="default"/> encoding for an EAT.
All claims in an EAT MUST use the same encoding except where explicitly allowed.
It is explicitly allowed for a nested token to be of a different encoding.
Some claims explicitly contain objects and messages that may use a different encoding than the enclosing EAT.</t>
        <t>This specification uses Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610" format="default"/> for all definitions.
The implementor interprets the CDDL to come to either the CBOR or JSON encoding.
In the case of JSON, Appendix E of <xref target="RFC8610" format="default"/> is followed.
Additional rules are given in <xref target="jsoninterop" format="default"/> where Appendix E is insufficient.</t>
        <t>The CWT and JWT specifications were authored before CDDL was available and did not use CDDL.
This specification includes a CDDL definition of most of what is defined in <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/>.
Similarly, this specification includes CDDL for most of what is defined in <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/>.</t>
        <t>The UCCS specification does not include CDDL.
This specification provides CDDL for it.</t>

      <section anchor="operating-model-and-rats-architecture" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Operating Model and RATS Architecture</name>
        <t>While it is not required that EAT be used with the RATS operational model described in Figure 1 in <xref target="RATS.Architecture" format="default"/>, or even that it be used for attestation, this document is oriented around that model.</t>
        <t>To summarize, an Attester generates Attestation Evidence.
Attestation Evidence is a claims set describing various characteristics of an entity.
Attestation Evidence also is usually signed by a key that proves the entity and the evidence it produces are authentic.
The claims set includes a nonce or some other means to provide freshness.
EAT is designed to carry Attestation Evidence.
The Attestation Evidence goes to a Verifier where the signature is verified.
Some of the claims may also be checked against Reference Values.
The Verifier then produces Attestation Results which is also usually a claims set.
EAT is also designed to carry Attestation Results.
The Attestation Results go to the Relying Party which is the ultimate consumer of the Remote Attestation Procedure.
The Relying Party uses the Attestation Results as needed for the use case, perhaps allowing an entity on the network, allowing a financial transaction or such.</t>
        <t>Note that sometimes the Verifier and Relying Party are not separate and thus there is no need for a protocol to carry Attestation Results.</t>
        <section anchor="relationship" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Relationship between Attestation Evidence and Attestation Results</name>
          <t>Any claim defined in this document or in the IANA CWT or JWT registry may be used in Attestation Evidence or Attestation Results.</t>
          <t>The relationship of claims in Attestation Results to Attestation Evidence is fundamentally governed by the Verifier and the Verifier's Policy.</t>
          <t>A common use case is for the Verifier and its Policy to perform checks, calculations and processing with Attestation Evidence as the input to produce a summary result in Attestation Results that indicates the overall health and status of the entity.
For example, measurements in Attestation Evidence may be compared to Reference Values the results of which are represented as a simple pass/fail in Attestation Results.</t>
          <t>It is also possible that some claims in the Attestation Evidence will be forwarded unmodified to the Relying Party in Attestation Results.
This forwarding is subject to the Verifier's implementation and Policy.
The Relying Party should be aware of the Verifier's Policy to know what checks it has performed on claims it forwards.</t>
          <t>The Verifier may also modify or transform claims it forwards.
This may be to implement some privacy preservation functionality.</t>
          <t>It is also possible the Verifier will put claims in the Attestation Results that give details about the entity that it has computed or looked up in a database.
For example, the Verifier may be able to put a HW OEM ID Claim in the Attestation Results by performing a look up based on a UEID (serial number) it received in Attestation Evidence.</t>
          <t>There are no hard rules for how a Verifier processes Attestation Evidence to produce Attestation Results.
What is important is the Relying Party understand what the Verifier does and what its policies are.</t>

      <t>CDDL, along with a text description, is used to define each claim

          <t>A UEID identifies an individual manufactured entity like a
mobile phone, a water meter, a Bluetooth speaker or a networked
security camera. It may identify the entire entity or a submodule.
It does not identify types, models or classes of
entities. It is akin to a serial number, though it does not have to be
sequential.</t>
          <t>UEIDs MUST be universally and globally unique across manufacturers
and countries. UEIDs MUST also be unique across protocols and systems,
as tokens are intended to be embedded in many different protocols and
systems. No two products anywhere, even in completely different
industries made by two different manufacturers in two different
countries should have the same UEID (if they are not global and
universal in this way, then Relying Parties receiving them will have
to track other characteristics of the entity to keep entities distinct
between manufacturers).</t>
          <t>There are privacy considerations for UEIDs. See <xref target="ueidprivacyconsiderations" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>The UEID is permanent. It MUST never change for a given entity.</t>
          <t>A UEID is constructed of a single type byte followed by the bytes that are the identifier.
Several types are allowed to accommodate different industries, different manufacturing processes

          <t>UEIDs are not designed for direct use by humans (e.g., printing on
the case of a device), so no textual representation is defined.</t>
          <t>The consumer of a UEID MUST treat a UEID as a
completely opaque string of bytes and not make any use of its internal
structure. For example, they should not use the OUI part of a type
0x02 UEID to identify the manufacturer of the entity. Instead, they
should use the OEMID claim. See <xref target="oemid" format="default"/>. The reasons for
this are:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>UEIDs types may vary freely from one manufacturer to the next.</li>
            <li>New types of UEIDs may be created. For example, a type 0x07 UEID may
be created based on some other manufacturer registration scheme.</li>
            <li>Entity manufacturers are allowed to change from one type of UEID to
another anytime they want. For example, they may find they can
optimize their manufacturing by switching from type 0x01 to type
0x02 or vice versa. The essential requirement on the manufacturer is
that UEIDs be universally unique.</li>
          </ul>

          <t>An SEUID is of the same format as a UEID, but it MAY change to a different value on device life-cycle events.
Examples of these events are change of ownership, factory reset and on-boarding into an IoT device management system.
An entity MAY have both a UEID and SUEIDs, neither, one or the other.</t>
          <t>There MAY be multiple SUEIDs.
Each one has a text string label the purpose of which is to distinguish it from others in the token.
The label MAY name the purpose, application or type of the SUEID.
Typically, there will be few SUEDs so there is no need for a formal labeling mechanism like a registry.
The EAT profile MAY describe how SUEIDs should be labeled.
If there is only one SUEID, the claim remains a map and there still must be a label.
For example, the label for the SUEID used by FIDO Onboarding Protocol could simply be "FDO".</t>

This claim uses that database to identify OEMs. The contents of the
claim may be either an IEEE MA-L, MA-M, MA-S or an IEEE CID
<xref target="IEEE.RA" format="default"/>.  An MA-L, formerly known as an OUI, is a 24-bit value
used as the first half of a MAC address. MA-M similarly is a 28-bit
value uses as the first part of a MAC address, and MA-S, formerly
known as OUI-36, a 36-bit value.  Many companies already have purchased
one of these. A CID is also a 24-bit value from the same space as an
MA-L, but not for use as a MAC address.  IEEE has published Guidelines
for Use of EUI, OUI, and CID <xref target="OUI.Guide" format="default"/> and provides a lookup

It is akin to the secure-restricted level (see below) without the

Often these can be considered more secure than unrestricted just because they are much simpler and a smaller attack surface, but this won't always be the case.

          <name>Debug Status Claim (debug-status)</name>
          <t>This applies to entity-wide or submodule-wide debug facilities of the
entity like JTAG and diagnostic hardware built into
chips. It applies to any software debug facilities related to root,
operating system or privileged software that allow system-wide memory
inspection, tracing or modification of non-system software like user
mode applications.</t>
          <t>This characterization assumes that debug facilities can be enabled and
disabled in a dynamic way or be disabled in some permanent way such
that no enabling is possible. An example of dynamic enabling is one
where some authentication is required to enable debugging. An example
of permanent disabling is blowing a hardware fuse in a chip. The specific
type of the mechanism is not taken into account. For example, it does
not matter if authentication is by a global password or by per-entity
public keys.</t>
          <t>As with all claims, the absence of the debug level claim means it is not reported.
A conservative interpretation might assume the enabled state.</t>
          <t>This claim is not extensible so as to provide a common interoperable description of debug status.
If a particular implementation considers this claim to be inadequate, it can define its own proprietary claim.
It may consider including both this claim as a coarse indication of debug status and its own proprietary claim as a refined indication.</t>
          <t>The higher levels of debug disabling requires that all debug disabling
of the levels below it be in effect. Since the lowest level requires
that all of the target's debug be currently disabled, all other levels
require that too.</t>
          <t>There is no inheritance of claims from a submodule to a superior
module or vice versa. There is no assumption, requirement or guarantee
that the target of a superior module encompasses the targets of
submodules. Thus, every submodule must explicitly describe its own
debug state. The receiver of an EAT MUST not
assume that debug is turned off in a submodule because there is a claim
indicating it is turned off in a superior module.</t>
          <t>An entity may have multiple debug
facilities. The use of plural in the description of the states
refers to that, not to any aggregation or inheritance.</t>
          <t>The architecture of some chips or devices may be such that a debug
facility operates for the whole chip or device. If the EAT for such
a chip includes submodules, then each submodule should independently
report the status of the whole-chip or whole-device debug facility.
This is the only way the receiver can know the debug status
of the submodules since there is no inheritance.</t>

          <name>The Software Manifests Claim (manifests)</name>
          <t>This claim contains descriptions of software present on the entity.
These manifests are installed on the entity when the software is installed or are created as part of the installation process.
Installation is anything that adds software to the entity, possibly factory installation, the user installing elective applications and so on.
The defining characteristic is they are created by the software manufacturer.
The purpose of these claims in an EAT is to relay them without modification to the Verifier and possibly to the Relying Party.</t>
          <t>Some manifests may be signed by their software manufacturer before they are put into this EAT claim.
When such manifests are put into this claim, the manufacturer's signature SHOULD be included.
For example, the manifest might be a CoSWID signed by the software manufacturer, in which case the full signed CoSWID should be put in this claim.</t>
          <t>This claim allows multiple formats for the manifest.
For example, the manifest may be a CBOR-format CoSWID, an XML-format SWID or other.
Identification of the type of manifest is always by a CBOR tag.
In many cases, for examples CoSWID, a tag will already be registered with IANA.
If not, a tag MUST be registered.
It can be in the first-come-first-served space which has minimal requirements for registration.</t>
          <t>The claim is an array of one or more manifests.
To facilitate hand off of the manifest to a decoding library, each manifest is contained in a byte string.
This occurs for CBOR-format manifests as well as non-CBOR format manifests.</t>
          <t>If a particular manifest type uses CBOR encoding, then the item in the array for it MUST be a byte string that contains a CBOR tag.
The EAT decoder must decode the byte string and then the CBOR within it to find the tag number to identify the type of manifest.
The contents of the byte string is then handed to the particular manifest processor for that type of manifest.
CoSWID and SUIT manifest are examples of this.</t>
          <t>If a particular manifest type does not use CBOR encoding, then the item in the array for it MUST be a CBOR tag that contains a byte string.
The EAT decoder uses the tag to identify the processor for that type of manifest.
The contents of the tag, the byte string, are handed to the manifest processor.
Note that a byte string is used to contain the manifest whether it is a text based format or not.
An example of this is an XML format ISO/IEC 19770 SWID.</t>
          <t>It is not possible to describe the above requirements in CDDL, so the type for an individual manifest is any in the CDDL below.
The above text sets the encoding requirement.</t>
          <t>This claim allows for multiple manifests in one token since multiple software packages are likely to be present.
The multiple manifests MAY be of multiple formats.
In some cases EAT submodules may be used instead of the array structure in this claim for multiple manifests.</t>
          <t>When the <xref target="CoSWID" format="default"/> format is used, it MUST be a payload CoSWID, not an evidence CoSWID.</t>

It is typically produced by a separate Attester.
It is typically used by a Composite Device as described in RATS Architecture <xref target="RATS.Architecture" format="default"/>
In being a submodule of the surrounding token, it is cryptographically bound to the surrounding token.
If it was conveyed in parallel with the surrounding token, there would be no such binding and attackers could substitute a good attestation from another device for the attestation of an errant subsystem.</t>
              <t>A nested token does not need to use the same encoding as the enclosing token.
This is to allow Composite Devices to be built without regards to the encoding supported by their Attesters.
Thus a CBOR-encoded token like a CWT or UCCS can have a JWT as a nested token submodule and a JSON-encoded token can have a CWT or UCCS as a nested token submodule.</t>

              <t>This is type of submodule equivalent to a Claims-Set submodule, except the Claims-Set is conveyed separately outside of the token.</t>
              <t>This type of submodule consists of a digest made using a cryptographic hash of a Claims-Set.
The Claims-Set is not included in the token.
It is conveyed to the Verifier outside of the token.
The submodule containing the digest is called a detached digest.
The separately conveyed Claims-Set is called a detached claims set.</t>
              <t>The input to the digest is exactly the byte-string wrapped encoded form of the Claims-Set for the submodule.
That Claims-Set can include other submodules including nested tokens and detached digests.</t>
              <t>The primary use for this is to facilitate the implementation of a small and secure attester, perhaps purely in hardware.
This small, secure attester implements COSE signing and only a few claims, perhaps just UEID and hardware identification.
It has inputs for digests of submodules, perhaps 32-byte hardware registers.
Software running on the device constructs larger claim sets, perhaps very large, encodes them and digests them.
The digests are written into the small secure attesters registers.
The EAT produced by the small secure attester only contains the UEID, hardware identification and digests and is thus simple enough to be implemented in hardware.
Probably, every data item in it is of fixed length.</t>
              <t>The integrity protection for the larger Claims Sets will not be as secure as those originating in hardware block, but the key material and hardware-based claims will be.
It is possible for the hardware to enforce hardware access control (memory protection)  on the digest registers so that some of the larger claims can be more secure.
For example, one register may be writable only by the TEE, so the detached claims from the TEE will have TEE-level security.</t>
              <t>The data type for this type of submodule MUST be an array
It contains two data items, an algorithm identifier and a byte string containing the digest.</t>
              <t>When decoding a CBOR format token the detached digest type is distringuished from the other types by it being an array.
In CBOR the none of other submodule types are arrays.</t>
              <t>When decoding a JSON format token, a little more work is required because both the nested token and detached digest types are an array.
To distinguish the nested token from the detached digest, the first element in the array is examined.
If it is "JWT", "UJCS" or "DEB", the the submodule is a nested token.
Otherwise it will contain an algorithm identifier and is a detached digest.</t>
              <t>A DEB, described in <xref target="DEB" format="default"/>, may be used to convey detached claims sets and the token with their detached digests.
EAT, however, doesn't require use of a DEB.
Any other protocols may be used to convey detached claims sets and the token with their detached digests.
Note that since detached Claims-Sets are usually signed, protocols conveying them must make sure they are not modified in transit.</t>

be less than or equal to that of the containing modules in the case of non-token
submodules. It makes no sense for a module of lesser security to be
signing claims of a module of higher security. An example of this is a
TEE signing claims made by the non-TEE parts (e.g. the high-level OS)
of the device.</t>
            <t>The opposite may be true for the nested tokens. They usually have
their own more secure key material. An example of this is an embedded

          <t>CWT allows the use floating-point for this claim. EAT disallows
the use of floating-point. An EAT token MUST NOT contain an iat claim in
float-point format. Any recipient of a token with a floating-point
format iat claim MUST consider it an error.  A 64-bit integer 
representation of epoch time can represent a range of +/- 500 billion
years, so the only point of a floating-point timestamp is to

        <name>Including Keys</name>
        <t>An EAT may include a cryptographic key such as a public key.
The signing of the EAT binds the key to all the other claims in the token.</t>
        <t>The purpose for inclusion of the key may vary by use case.
For example, the key may be included as part of an IoT device onboarding protocol.
When the FIDO protocol includes a public key in its attestation message, the key represents the binding of a user, device and Relying Party.
This document describes how claims containing keys should be defined for the various use cases.
It does not define specific claims for specific use cases.</t>
        <t>Keys in CBOR format tokens SHOULD be the COSE_Key format <xref target="RFC8152" format="default"/> and keys in JSON format tokens SHOULD be the JSON Web Key format <xref target="RFC7517" format="default"/>.
These two formats support many common key types.
Their use avoids the need to decode other serialization formats.
These two formats can be extended to support further key types through their IANA registries.</t>
        <t>The general confirmation claim format <xref target="RFC8747" format="default"/>, <xref target="RFC7800" format="default"/> may also be used.
It provides key encryption. 
It also allows for inclusion by reference through a key ID.
The confirmation claim format may employed in the definition of some new claim for a a particular use case.</t>
        <t>When the actual confirmation claim is included in an EAT, this document associates no use case semantics other than proof of possession.
Different EAT use cases may choose to associate further semantics.
The key in the confirmation claim MUST be protected in the same way as the key used to sign the EAT. 
That is, the same, equivalent or better hardware defenses, access controls, key generation and such must be used.</t>

      <name>Detached EAT Bundles</name>
      <t>A detached EAT bundle is a structure to convey a fully-formed and signed token plus detached claims set that relate to that token.
It is a top-level EAT message like a CWT, JWT, UCCS and UJCS.
It can be used any place that CWT, JWT, UCCS or UJCS messages are used.
It may also be sent as a submodule.</t>
      <t>A DEB has two main parts.</t>
      <t>The first part is a full top-level token.
This top-level token must have at least one submodule that is a detached digest.
This top-level token may be either CBOR or JSON-encoded.
It may be a CWT, JWT, UCCS or UJCS, but not a DEB.
The same mechanism for distinguishing the type for nested token submodules is used here.</t>
      <t>The second part is a map/object containing the detached Claims-Sets corresponding to the detached digests in the full token.
When the DEB is CBOR-encoded, each Claims-Set is wrapped in a byte string.
When the DEB is JSON-encoded, each Claims-Set is base64url encoded.
All the detached Claims-Sets MUST be encoded in the same format as the DEB.
No mixing of encoding formats is allowed for the Claims-Sets in a DEB.</t>
      <t>For CBOR-encoded DEBs, tag TBD602 can be used to identify it.
The normal rules apply for use or non-use of a tag.
When it is sent as a submodule, it is always sent as a tag to distinguish it from the other types of nested tokens.</t>
      <t>The digests of the detached claims sets are associated with detached claims-sets by label/name.
It is up to the constructor of the detached EAT bundle to ensure the names uniquely identify the detached claims sets.

      <name>Endorsements and Verification Keys</name>
      <t>The Verifier must possess the correct key when it performs the cryptographic part of an EAT verification (e.g., verifying the COSE/JOSE signature).
This section describes several ways to identify the verification key.
There is not one standard method.</t>
      <t>The verification key itself may be a public key, a symmetric key or something complicated in the case of a scheme like Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA).</t>
      <t>RATS Architecture <xref target="RATS.Architecture" format="default"/> describes what is called an Endorsement.
This is an input to the Verifier that is usually the basis of the trust placed in an EAT and the Attester that generated it.
It may contain the public key for verification of the signature on the EAT.
It may contain Reference Values to which EAT claims are compared as part of the verification process.
It may contain implied claims, those that are passed on to the Relying Party in Attestation Results.</t>
      <t>There is not yet any standard format(s) for an Endorsement.
One format that may be used for an Endorsement is an X.509 certificate.
Endorsement data like Reference Values and implied claims can be carried in X.509 v3 extensions.
In this use, the public key in the X.509 certificate becomes the verification key, so identification of the Endorsement is also identification of the verification key.</t>
      <t>The verification key identification and establishment of trust in the EAT and the attester may also be by some other means than an Endorsement.</t>
      <t>For the components (Attester, Verifier, Relying Party,...) of a particular end-end attestation system to reliably interoperate, its definition should specify how the verification key is identified.
Usually, this will be in the profile document for a particular attestation system.</t>
      <section anchor="identification-methods" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Identification Methods</name>
        <t>Following is a list of possible methods of key identification. A specific attestation system may employ any one of these or one not listed here.</t>
        <t>The following assumes Endorsements are X.509 certificates or equivalent and thus does not mention or define any identifier for Endorsements in other formats. If such an Endorsement format is created, new identifiers for them will also need to be created.</t>

          <t>COSE leaves the semantics of the key ID open-ended.
It could be a record locator in a database, a hash of a public key, an input to a KDF, an authority key identifier (AKI) for an X.509 certificate or other.
The profile document should specify what the key ID's semantics are.</t>

          <t>For some attestation systems, a claim may be re-used as a key identifier. For example, the UEID uniquely identifies the entity and therefore can work well as a key identifier or Endorsement identifier.</t>
          <t>This has the advantage that key identification requires no additional bytes in the EAT and makes the EAT smaller.</t>
          <t>This has the disadvantage that the unverified EAT must be substantially decoded to obtain the identifier since the identifier is in the COSE/JOSE payload, not in the headers.</t>

      <section anchor="other-considerations" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Other Considerations</name>
        <t>In all cases there must be some way that the verification key is itself verified or determined to be trustworthy.
The key identification itself is never enough.
This will always be by some out-of-band mechanism that is not described here.
For example, the Verifier may be configured with a root certificate or a master key by the Verifier system administrator.</t>
        <t>Often an X.509 certificate or an Endorsement carries more than just the verification key.
For example, an X.509 certificate might have key usage constraints and an Endorsement might have Reference Values.
When this is the case, the key identifier must be either a protected header or in the payload such that it is cryptographically bound to the EAT.

It is a goal that there be general-purpose verification implementations that can verify tokens for large numbers of use cases with special cases and configurations for different device types.
This is a goal of interoperability of the semantics of claims themselves, not just of the signing, encoding and serialization formats.</t>
          <t>This is a lofty goal and difficult to achieve broadly requiring careful definition of claims in a technology neutral way.

They should also be applicable to multiple small embedded operating systems from multiple vendors and everything in between.</t>

          <t>Claims should not be defined such that they are specific to a chip or particular hardware. 
For example, they should not just be the contents of some HW status register as it is unlikely that the same HW status register with the same bits exists on a chip of a different manufacturer.</t>

This takes advantage of the expertise put into creating those formats and improves interoperability.</t>
          <t>Often extant claims will not be defined in an encoding or serialization format used by EAT.
It is preferred to define a CBOR and JSON format for them so that EAT implementations do not require a plethora of encoders and decoders for serialization formats.</t>
          <t>In some cases, it may be better to use the encoding and serialization as is.

Claims" registry established by <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/> and the "CBOR Web Token Claims Registry"
established by <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/>. Each entry below is an addition to both registries (except
for the nonce claim which is already registered for JWT, but not registered for CWT).</t>
        <t>The "Claim Description", "Change Controller" and "Specification Documents" are common and equivalent for the JWT and CWT registries.
The "Claim Key" and "Claim Value Types(s)" are for the CWT registry only.
The "Claim Name" is as defined for the CWT registry, not the JWT registry.
The "JWT Claim Name" is equivalent to the "Claim Name" in the JWT registry.</t>

          <name>Claims for Early Assignment</name>
          <t>RFC Editor: in the final publication this section should be combined with the following
section as it will no longer be necessary to distinguish claims with early assignment.
Also, the following paragraph should be removed.</t>
          <t>The claims in this section have been (requested for / given) early assignment according to <xref target="RFC7120" format="default"/>.
They have been assigned values and registered before final publication of this document.
While their semantics is not expected to change in final publication, it is possible that they will.
The JWT Claim Names and CWT Claim Keys are not expected to change.</t>
          <t>In draft -06 an early allocation was described.
The processing of that early allocation was never correctly completed.
This early allocation assigns different numbers for the CBOR claim labels.
This early allocation will presumably complete correctly</t>

      <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t>Certain EAT claims can be used to track the owner of an entity and
therefore, implementations should consider providing privacy-preserving
options dependent on the intended usage of the EAT.  Examples would
include suppression of location claims for EAT's provided to
unauthenticated consumers.</t>
      <section anchor="ueidprivacyconsiderations" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>UEID and SUEID Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>A UEID is usually not privacy-preserving. Any set of Relying Parties
that receives tokens that happen to be from a particular entity will be
able to know the tokens are all from the same entity and be able to
track it.</t>
        <t>Thus, in many usage situations UEID violates
governmental privacy regulation. In other usage situations a UEID will
not be allowed for certain products like browsers that give privacy
for the end user. It will often be the case that tokens will not have
a UEID for these reasons.</t>
        <t>An SUEID is also usually not privacy-preserving.  In some cases it may
have fewer privacy issues than a UEID depending on when and how and
when it is generated.</t>
        <t>There are several strategies that can be used to still be able to put
UEIDs and SUEIDs in tokens:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>The entity obtains explicit permission from the user of the entity
to use the UEID/SUEID. This may be through a prompt. It may also be through
a license agreement.  For example, agreements for some online banking
and brokerage services might already cover use of a UEID/SUEID.</li>
          <li>The UEID/SUEID is used only in a particular context or particular use
case. It is used only by one Relying Party.</li>
          <li>The entity authenticates the Relying Party and generates a derived
UEID/SUEID just for that particular Relying Party.  For example, the Relying
Party could prove their identity cryptographically to the entity, then
the entity generates a UEID just for that Relying Party by hashing a
proofed Relying Party ID with the main entity UEID/SUEID.</li>
        </ul>
        <t>Note that some of these privacy preservation strategies result in
multiple UEIDs and SUEIDs per entity. Each UEID/SUEID is used in a
different context, use case or system on the entity. However, from the
view of the Relying Party, there is just one UEID and it is still
globally universal across manufacturers.</t>

      <section anchor="locationprivacyconsiderations" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Location Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>Geographic location is most always considered personally identifiable information.
Implementers should consider laws and regulations governing the transmission of location data from end user devices to servers and services.
Implementers should consider using location management facilities offered by the operating system on the entity generating the attestation.
For example, many mobile phones prompt the user for permission when before sending location data.</t>

      <section anchor="replayprivacyconsiderations" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Replay Protection and Privacy</name>
        <t>EAT offers 2 primary mechanisms for token replay protection (also sometimes
known as token "freshness"):  the cti/jti claim and the nonce claim.  The cti/jti claim
in a CWT/JWT is a field that may be optionally included in the EAT and is in general
derived on the same device in which the entity is instantiated.  The nonce claim is based
on a value that is usually derived remotely (outside of the entity).  These claims can be used
to extract and convey personally-identifying information either inadvertently or by intention.  For instance,
an implementor may choose a cti that is equivalent to a username associated with the device (e.g., account
login).  If the token is inspected by a 3rd-party then this information could be used to identify the source
of the token or an account associated with the token (e.g., if the account name is used to derive the nonce).  In order
to avoid the conveyance of privacy-related information in either the cti/jti or nonce claims, these fields
should be derived using a salt that originates from a true and reliable random number generator or any other
source of randomness that would still meet the target system requirements for replay protection.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security considerations provided in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/> and Section 11
of <xref target="RFC7519" format="default"/> apply to EAT in its CWT and JWT form, respectively.  In addition, 
implementors should consider the following.</t>
      <section anchor="key-provisioning" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Key Provisioning</name>
        <t>Private key material can be used to sign and/or encrypt the EAT, or
can be used to derive the keys used for signing and/or encryption.  In
some instances, the manufacturer of the entity may create the key
material separately and provision the key material in the entity
itself.  The manfuacturer of any entity that is capable of producing
an EAT should take care to ensure that any private key material be
suitably protected prior to provisioning the key material in the
entity itself.  This can require creation of key material in an
enclave (see <xref target="RFC4949" format="default"/> for definition of "enclave"), secure
transmission of the key material from the enclave to the entity using
an appropriate protocol, and persistence of the private key material
in some form of secure storage to which (preferably) only the entity
has access.</t>
        <section anchor="transmission-of-key-material" numbered="true" toc="default">
          <name>Transmission of Key Material</name>
          <t>Regarding transmission of key material from the enclave to the entity,
the key material may pass through one or more intermediaries.
Therefore some form of protection ("key wrapping") may be necessary.
The transmission itself may be performed electronically, but can also
be done by human courier.  In the latter case, there should be minimal
to no exposure of the key material to the human (e.g. encrypted
portable memory).  Moreover, the human should transport the key
material directly from the secure enclave where it was created to a
destination secure enclave where it can be provisioned.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section anchor="transport-security" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Transport Security</name>
        <t>As stated in Section 8 of <xref target="RFC8392" format="default"/>, "The security of the CWT relies
upon on the protections offered by COSE".  Similar considerations
apply to EAT when sent as a CWT.  However, EAT introduces the concept
of a nonce to protect against replay.  Since an EAT may be created by
an entity that may not support the same type of transport security as
the consumer of the EAT, intermediaries may be required to bridge
communications between the entity and consumer.  As a result, it is
RECOMMENDED that both the consumer create a nonce, and the entity
leverage the nonce along with COSE mechanisms for encryption and/or
signing to create the EAT.</t>
        <t>Similar considerations apply to the use of EAT as a JWT.  Although the
security of a JWT leverages the JSON Web Encryption (JWE) and JSON Web
Signature (JWS) specifications, it is still recommended to make use of
the EAT nonce.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="multiple-eat-consumers" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Multiple EAT Consumers</name>
        <t>In many cases, more than one EAT consumer may be required to fully
verify the entity attestation.  Examples include individual consumers
for nested EATs, or consumers for individual claims with an EAT.  When
multiple consumers are required for verification of an EAT, it is
important to minimize information exposure to each consumer.  In
addition, the communication between multiple consumers should be
secure.</t>
        <t>For instance, consider the example of an encrypted and signed EAT with
multiple claims.  A consumer may receive the EAT (denoted as the
"receiving consumer"), decrypt its payload, verify its signature, but
then pass specific subsets of claims to other consumers for evaluation
("downstream consumers").  Since any COSE encryption will be removed
by the receiving consumer, the communication of claim subsets to any
downstream consumer should leverage a secure protocol (e.g.one that
uses transport-layer security, i.e. TLS),</t>
        <t>However, assume the EAT of the previous example is hierarchical and
each claim subset for a downstream consumer is created in the form of
a nested EAT.  Then transport security between the receiving and
downstream consumers is not strictly required.  Nevertheless,
downstream consumers of a nested EAT should provide a nonce unique to
the EAT they are consuming.</t>

              <t>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.  This specification defines the generic URI syntax and a process for resolving URI references that might be in relative form, along with guidelines and security considerations for the use of URIs on the Internet.  The URI syntax defines a grammar that is a superset of all valid URIs, allowing an implementation to parse the common components of a URI reference without knowing the scheme-specific requirements of every possible identifier.  This specification does not define a generative grammar for URIs; that task is performed by the individual specifications of each URI scheme.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format designed for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the ability to have basic security services defined for this data format. This document defines the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) protocol.  This specification describes how to create and process signatures, message authentication codes, and encryption using CBOR for serialization.  This specification additionally describes how to represent cryptographic keys using CBOR.</t>

              <t>   ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 Software Identification (SWID) tags provide an
   extensible XML-based structure to identify and describe individual
   software components, patches, and installation bundles.  SWID tag
   representations can be too large for devices with network and storage
   constraints.  This document defines a concise representation of SWID
   tags: Concise SWID (CoSWID) tags.  CoSWID supports a similar set of
   semantics and features as SWID tags, as well as new semantics that
   allow CoSWIDs to describe additional types of information, all in a
   more memory efficient format.

            <abstract>
              <t>   In network protocol exchanges it is often useful for one end of a
   communication to know whether the other end is in an intended
   operating state.  This document provides an architectural overview of
   the entities involved that make such tests possible through the
   process of generating, conveying, and evaluating evidentiary claims.
   An attempt is made to provide for a model that is neutral toward
   processor architectures, the content of claims, and protocols.

            <abstract>
              <t>   The CBOR Signing And Encrypted Message (COSE) structure uses
   references to keys in general.  For some algorithms, additional
   properties are defined which carry parameters relating to keys as
   needed.  The COSE Key structure is used for transporting keys outside
   of COSE messages.  This document extends the way that keys can be
   identified and transported by providing attributes that refer to or
   contain X.509 certificates.

            <abstract>
              <t>   This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates.  The
   resulting certificates are called C509 Certificates.  The CBOR
   encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280 and all certificates
   compatible with the RFC 7925, IEEE 802.1AR (DevID), CNSA, RPKI, GSMA
   eUICC, and CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements profiles.  When
   used to re-encode DER encoded X.509 certificates, the CBOR encoding
   can in many cases reduce the size of RFC 7925 profiled certificates
   with over 50%.  The CBOR encoded structure can alternatively be
   signed directly ("natively signed"), which does not require re-
   encoding for the signature to be verified.  The document also
   specifies C509 COSE headers, a C509 TLS certificate type, and a C509
   file format.

        <name>Collision Probability</name>
        <t>This calculation is to determine the probability of a collision of
UEIDs given the total possible entity population and the number of
entities in a particular entity management database.</t>
        <t>Three different sized databases are considered. The number of devices
per person roughly models non-personal devices such as traffic lights,
devices in stores they shop in, facilities they work in and so on,
even considering individual light bulbs. A device may have
individually attested subsystems, for example parts of a car or a
mobile phone. It is assumed that the largest database will have at
most 10% of the world's population of devices. Note that databases
that handle more than a trillion records exist today.</t>
        <t>The trillion-record database size models an easy-to-imagine reality
over the next decades. The quadrillion-record database is roughly at
the limit of what is imaginable and should probably be accommodated.
The 100 quadrillion datadbase is highly speculative perhaps involving
nanorobots for every person, livestock animal and domesticated
bird. It is included to round out the analysis.</t>
        <t>Note that the items counted here certainly do not have IP address and
are not individually connected to the network. They may be connected
to internal buses, via serial links, Bluetooth and so on.  This is
not the same problem as sizing IP addresses.</t>

        <t>Next, to calculate the probability of a collision occurring in one year's 
operation of a database, it is assumed that the database size is in
a steady state and that 10% of the database changes per year. For example,
a trillion record database would have 100 billion states per year. Each
of those states has the above calculated probability of a collision.</t>
        <t>This assumption is a worst-case since it assumes that each
state of the database is completely independent from the previous state.
In reality this is unlikely as state changes will be the addition or
deletion of a few records.</t>

be a minimum of 128 bits.</t>
        <t>There is no requirement for 256 bits today as quadrillion-record databases
are not expected in the near future and because this time-to-collision
calculation is a very worst case.  A future update of the standard may
increase the requirement to 256 bits, so there is a requirement that
implementations be able to receive 256-bit UEIDs.</t>

      <section anchor="no-use-of-uuid" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>No Use of UUID</name>
        <t>A UEID is not a UUID <xref target="RFC4122" format="default"/> by conscious choice for the following
reasons.</t>
        <t>UUIDs are limited to 128 bits which may not be enough for some future
use cases.</t>
        <t>Today, cryptographic-quality random numbers are available from common
CPUs and hardware. This hardware was introduced between 2010 and 2015.
Operating systems and cryptographic libraries give access to this 
hardware. Consequently, there is little need for implementations
to construct such random values from multiple sources on their own.</t>
        <t>Version 4 UUIDs do allow for use of such cryptographic-quality 
random numbers, but do so by mapping into the overall UUID 
structure of time and clock values. This structure is of no
value here yet adds complexity. It also slightly reduces the
number of actual bits with entropy.</t>
        <t>UUIDs seem to have been designed for scenarios where the implementor
does not have full control over the environment and uniqueness has to
be constructed from identifiers at hand. UEID takes the view that
hardware, software and/or manufacturing process directly implement
UEID in a simple and direct way. It takes the view that cryptographic
quality random number generators are readily available as they are
implemented in commonly used CPU hardware.</t>

      <name>EAT Relation to IEEE.802.1AR Secure Device Identity (DevID)</name>
      <t>This section describes several distinct ways in which an IEEE IDevID <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/> relates to EAT, particularly to UEID and SUEID.</t>
      <t><xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/> orients around the definition of an implementation called a "DevID Module."
It describes how IDevIDs and LDevIDs are stored, protected and accessed using a DevID Module.
A particular level of defense against attack that should be achieved to be a DevID is defined.
The intent is that IDevIDs and LDevIDs are used with an open set of network protocols for authentication and such.
In these protocols the DevID secret is used to sign a nonce or similar to proof the association of the DevID certificates with the device.</t>
      <t>By contrast, EAT defines network protocol for proving trustworthiness to a Relying Party, the very thing that is not defined in <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/>.
Nor does not give details on how keys, data and such are stored protected and accessed.
EAT is intended to work with a variety of different on-device implementations ranging from minimal protection of assets to the highest levels of asset protection.
It does not define any particular level of defense against attack, instead providing a set of security considerations.</t>
      <t>EAT and DevID can be viewed as complimentary when used together or as competing to provide a device identity service.</t>
      <section anchor="devid-used-with-eat" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>DevID Used With EAT</name>
        <t>As just described, EAT defines a network protocol and <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/> doesn't.
Vice versa, EAT doesn't define a an device implementation and DevID does.</t>
        <t>Hence, EAT can be the network protocol that a DevID is used with.
The DevID secret becomes the attestation key used to sign EATs.
The DevID and its certificate chain become the Endorsement sent to the Verifier.</t>
        <t>In this case the EAT and the DevID are likely to both provide a device identifier (e.g. a serial number).
In the EAT it is the UEID (or SUEID).
In the DevID (used as an endorsement), it is a device serial number included in the subject field of the DevID certificate.
It is probably a good idea in this use for them to be the same serial number or for the UEID to be a hash of the DevID serial number.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="how-eat-provides-an-equivalent-secure-device-identity" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>How EAT Provides an Equivalent Secure Device Identity</name>
        <t>The UEID, SUEID and other claims like OEM ID are equivalent to the secure device identity put into the subject field of a DevID certificate.
These EAT claims can represent all the same fields and values that can be put in a DevID certificate subject.
EAT explicitly and carefully defines a variety of useful claims.</t>
        <t>EAT secures the conveyance of these claims by having them signed on the device by the attestation key when the EAT is generated.
EAT also signs the nonce that gives freshness at this time.
Since these claims are signed for every EAT generated, they can include things that vary over time like GPS location.</t>
        <t>DevID secures the device identity fields by having them signed by the manufacturer of the device sign them into a certificate.
That certificate is created once during the manufacturing of the device and never changes so the fields cannot change.</t>
        <t>So in one case the signing of the identity happens on the device and the other in a manufacturing facility,
but in both cases the signing of the nonce that proves the binding to the actual device happens on the device.</t>
        <t>While EAT does not specify how the signing keys, signature process and storage of the identity values should be secured against attack,
an EAT implementation may have equal defenses against attack.
One reason EAT uses CBOR is because it is simple enough that a basic EAT implementation can be constructed entirely in hardware.
This allows EAT to be implemented with the strongest defenses possible.</t>

      <section anchor="an-x509-format-eat" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>An X.509 Format EAT</name>
        <t>It is possible to define a way to encode EAT claims in an X.509 certificate.
For example, the EAT claims might be mapped to X.509 v3 extensions.
It is even possible to stuff a whole CBOR-encoded unsigned EAT token into a X.509 certificate.</t>
        <t>If that X.509 certificate is an IDevID or LDevID, this becomes another way to use EAT and DevID together.</t>
        <t>Note that the DevID must still be used with an authentication protocol that has a nonce or equivalent.
The EAT here is not being used as the protocol to interact with the rely party.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="device-identifier-permanence" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Device Identifier Permanence</name>
        <t>In terms of permanence, an IDevID is similar to a UEID in that they do not change over the life of the device.
They cease to exist only when the device is destroyed.</t>
        <t>An SUEID is similar to an LDevID.
They change on device life-cycle events.</t>
        <t><xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/> describes much of this permanence as resistant to attacks that seek to change the ID.
IDevID permanence can be described this way because <xref target="IEEE.802.1AR" format="default"/> is oriented around the definition of an implementation with a particular level of defense against attack.</t>
        <t>EAT is not defined around a particular implementation and must work on a range of devices that have a range of defenses against attack.
EAT thus can't be defined permanence in terms of defense against attack.
EAT's definition of permanence is in terms of operations and device lifecycle.</t>
